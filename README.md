# HW {week-4-game}
Crystal Collector game using jQuery
  
  1.  There are 4 images of gems that are each assigned a random value between 1 & 12, which is hidden from the player.  And a random goal number between 19 & 120.
  2.  Clicking on a gem will add the associated value to an accumulator.  Player continues clicking gems, attempting to match the goal number.
  3.  When the accumulator total meets the goal number exactly, the round is completed a wins counter is incremented +1
  4.  When the accumulator total exceeds the goal number, the round is completed and a loss counter is incremented +1
  5.  New gem values and the goal number will be regenerated for a new game.
